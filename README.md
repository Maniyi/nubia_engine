# NUBIA Engine

This repository will contain the rules engine for **NUBIA: AFRICAN CHESS**.
The authoritative game specification is [`docs/NUBIA_RULES.md`](docs/NUBIA_RULES.md),
with confirmed engine interpretations in
[`docs/ENGINE_DECISIONS.md`](docs/ENGINE_DECISIONS.md).

## Milestone 5

The engine provides immutable rules state plus deterministic ordinary movement,
capture, High Chief switching, Peasant movement, Imperion palace movement and
validated immutable transitions. It also implements Imperion GBESELE with
non-recursive ordinary-capture defence and mandatory simultaneous targets, along
with each Mystic's independent one-use Brainwash and re-brainwashing power.
Public generation includes ordinary and special actions in stable canonical order.
The post-action adjudication layer adds Peasant mine victory, no-Peasant officer
scoring, identity-independent threefold repetition, the 40-ply no-progress draw,
immutable global results, and terminal-state enforcement.
Milestone 5 adds deterministic engine display notation, a portable fixed-view
board renderer, immutable action replay, perft verification, and a two-human CLI.

Engine display notation is intentionally human-readable output, not a new
official notation standard and not a parseable serialization format.

Play locally with Empire A or B moving first:

```sh
python -m nubia_engine --first-player A
nubia --first-player B
```

## Development setup

Python 3.11 or later is required.

```sh
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the development checks with:

```sh
python -m pytest
python -m pytest --cov=nubia_engine --cov-report=term-missing
python -m ruff check .
python -m ruff format --check .
python -m mypy src tests
```

## Deferred work

Notation parsing, serialization/save files, heuristic evaluation, AI/search/training,
APIs, website integration, persistence, multiplayer, and deployment are intentionally
deferred to later milestones.
